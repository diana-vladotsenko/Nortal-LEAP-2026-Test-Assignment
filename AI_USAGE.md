# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.

AI tools (Claude and ChatGPT) were used to assist with generating and iterating on code solutions.

I used AI to:
- Explore possible implementations of the required backend behaviors.
- Speed up writing boilerplate and test cases.
- Validate logic against the assignment requirements.

All generated code was reviewed, adjusted and verified by me.
